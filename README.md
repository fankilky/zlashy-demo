Based on the comment provided, I have revised the code.
- Font Family: Poppins
- ‚Å†Animation: I have tried the best to make the animation most look like the demo video, but the animation on the desktop version is not ideal (the bubble part).
- Responsive: I revised the responsive design for 360px to 1920px.

This is the practical test for interviewing Zlashy.

Hi Terry,

Hope you're doing well!

I just finished the practical test you gave me. I have to admit, it's not perfect, but I really gave it my best shot. It was a great learning experience for me, and I appreciate the opportunity.

If you have any questions or need more info, just let me know. I'm excited to continue with the recruitment process and look forward to possibly joining Zlashy.

Thanks a lot for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Fanki Li
