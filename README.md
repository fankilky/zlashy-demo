This is the practical test for interviewing Zlashy.

Hi Terry,

Hope you're doing well!

I just finished the practical test you gave me. I have to admit, it's not perfect, but I really gave it my best shot. It was a great learning experience for me, and I appreciate the opportunity.

If you have any questions or need more info, just let me know. I'm excited to continue with the recruitment process and look forward to possibly joining Zlashy.

Thanks a lot for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Fanki Li
